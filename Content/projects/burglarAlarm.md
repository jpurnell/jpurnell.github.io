These files detail the breadboard connections you'll want to use for a 2-sensor burglar alarm with 2 LEDs and a buzzer. 

The final file is micropython code you can copy and paste that will work with the connections seen in the html or pdf file. 

If your pins change from how they're listed in the diagrams, you'll want to adjust the code to reflect which pins you're using.
