# Welcome to BusinessMath: A 12-Week Journey

**Your roadmap to mastering financial calculations, statistical analysis, and optimization in Swift**

---

Welcome! Over the next twelve weeks, we're going on a journey together—from calculating the basics of time value of money to building sophisticated portfolio optimizers and real-time trading systems. Whether you're a Swift developer curious about financial mathematics, a business analyst looking to bring your calculations into code, or someone who just loves solving practical problems with elegant tools, this series is for you.

## What is BusinessMath?

BusinessMath is a comprehensive Swift library that brings financial calculations, statistical analysis, and optimization algorithms to your fingertips. Need to calculate loan amortization schedules? Run Monte Carlo simulations? Optimize a portfolio under constraints? BusinessMath has you covered—with clean, type-safe APIs that work across all Apple platforms.

But this library is more than just a collection of functions. It's built on principles that matter: test-driven development, comprehensive documentation, and real-world applicability. Every calculation is tested, every API is documented, and every feature is designed to solve actual business problems.

## What to Expect

This series spans **12 weeks** with **3-4 posts per week**, mixing technical deep-dives with real-world case studies:

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation**
We'll start with the essentials—time series data, time value of money, and financial ratios. By the end of week 1, you'll build a complete retirement planning calculator.

**Weeks 3-5: Financial Modeling**
Learn to build growth models, revenue projections, and complete financial statements. We'll tackle real scenarios like capital equipment decisions and lease accounting.

**Weeks 6-8: Simulation & Optimization**
Monte Carlo simulations, scenario analysis, and portfolio optimization. The midpoint case study combines everything you've learned into a $10M portfolio optimizer.

**Weeks 9-12: Advanced Topics**
Integer programming, particle swarm optimization, parallel processing, and performance tuning. We'll close with reflections on building production-quality software and a complete investment strategy DSL.

Every few posts, we'll pause for a **case study**—a complete, real-world scenario that combines multiple topics into a practical solution. By the end, you'll have tackled 6 substantial business problems, from retirement planning to real-time portfolio rebalancing.

## Why Follow Along?

Each post is self-contained but builds on previous concepts. You'll get:
- **Runnable code examples** you can try immediately
- **Complete playgrounds** to experiment and modify
- **Links to comprehensive API documentation** when you want to dive deeper
- **Real business context** that explains why each technique matters

This isn't just theory—it's production-ready code solving real problems. And it's designed to be accessible whether you're implementing these calculations for the first time or you're a seasoned financial engineer exploring Swift.

## Ready to Begin?

We'll publish new posts **Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday**, with case studies every other Friday. Bookmark this series, follow along at your own pace, and don't hesitate to experiment with the code. The best way to learn is by doing.

Let's get started.
