[<p>Law360 (November 6, 2020, 5:59 PM EST) -- National Lampoon has sued its former president for fraud, alleging in New York federal court that he owes more than $3 million for surreptitiously funneling the company's intellectual property and money from deals with Quibi, Disney+ and Comedy Central Digital into companies he controls.</p>
<p>NLI Holdings LLC's suit filed on Thursday comes days after its former president, Evan Shapiro, launched a New York state court suit against the company and its attorneys at Freedman & Taitelman LLP.</p>
<p>NLI, which does business as National Lampoon, claimed on Thursday that Shapiro violated federal racketeering law, breached his fiduciary duty, committed wire fraud and stole from the company by working with his wife for a year and a half on a scheme to steal its assets and conceal the theft.</p>](https://justinpurnell.com/downloads/eshap-story.pdf)
