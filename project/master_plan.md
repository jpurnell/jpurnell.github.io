## Collaboration Principles

### AI as Sparring Partner, Not Oracle

AI proposes; the human interrogates. High AI confidence triggers harder questions, not faster acceptance.

- **Interrogate confident outputs.** When the AI states something with certainty, ask for the counterargument before accepting.
- **Demand counterarguments.** Before locking in an approach, require an explicit case for the strongest alternative.
- **Sit with discomfort.** Resist the pull to take the first plausible answer. Working through a hard call manually preserves the judgment that lets you catch the AI when it's wrong.

This principle is operationalized in the **Adversarial Review** step of `design_proposal.md` and is the canonical reference for any other doc that invokes it.

---

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- All code follows `coding_rules.md`
- Test coverage target: [80%+]
- Documentation for all public APIs
- No warnings in build output

### Documentation Quality
- DocC comments for all public functions
- Usage examples in documentation
- Articles for complex topics

---

## Error Registry

> **Purpose:** Single source of truth for all error types in the project. Consult this
> registry during the Design Proposal Phase to ensure new error cases don't duplicate
> existing ones. Update it whenever new error types are introduced.

### Error Types

| Error Enum | Case | When Thrown | Module |
|------------|------|------------|--------|
| `ProjectError` | `.emptyInput` | Collection is empty when non-empty is required | [Module] |
| `ProjectError` | `.invalidInput(message:)` | Parameter fails validation | [Module] |
| `ProjectError` | `.divisionByZero(context:)` | Denominator is zero or near-zero | [Module] |

*Add new error cases here as they are introduced. Remove this example content and replace with your project's actual errors.*

### Error Design Principles

- **One error enum per domain boundary** — avoid proliferating error types
- **Descriptive associated values** — include context (parameter name, expected range, etc.)
- **No overlapping cases** — `invalidParameter` and `outOfRange` should not coexist if they mean the same thing
- **Consult this registry** before creating new error cases in a Design Proposal
