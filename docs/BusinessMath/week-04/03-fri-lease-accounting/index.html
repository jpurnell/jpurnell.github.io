// Office lease: quarterly payments for 1 year

)

// Create lease with 6% annual discount rate (incremental borrowing rate)
let lease = Lease(
    payments: payments,
    discountRate: 0.06
)

// Calculate present value (lease liability)
let liability = lease.presentValue()
print("Initial lease liability: \(liability.currency())")  // ~$96,360

// Calculate right-of-use asset (initially equals liability)
let rouAsset = lease.rightOfUseAsset()
print("ROU asset: \(rouAsset.currency())")  // $96,360
</code></pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre><code>Initial lease liability: $96,360
ROU asset: $96,360
</code></pre><p><strong>The calculation</strong>: Four $25,000 payments discounted at 6% annual (1.5% quarterly) = $96,360 present value.</p><hr /><h3>Lease Liability Amortization Schedule</h3><p>Generate a complete amortization schedule showing how the liability decreases each period:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">let schedule = lease.liabilitySchedule()

print("=== Lease Liability Schedule ===")

</code></pre><p><strong>The insight</strong>: Interest expense decreases each period as the liability balance declines (front-loaded interest).</p><hr /><h3>Including Initial Direct Costs and Prepayments</h3><p>Many leases include upfront costs that increase the ROU asset:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">let leaseWithCosts = Lease(

print("ROU asset: \(rouAsset.currency())")          // $111,454
print("\nDifference: \((rouAsset - liability).currency())")  // $15,000 (costs + prepayment)
</code></pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre><code>=== Initial Recognition with Costs ===
Lease liability: $96,360
ROU asset: $111,360

Difference: $15,000
</code></pre><p><strong>The accounting</strong>: Liability = PV of future payments. Asset = Liability + upfront costs + prepayments.</p><hr /><h3>Depreciation of ROU Asset</h3><p>ROU assets are depreciated straight-line over the lease term:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">print("\n=== ROU Asset Depreciation ===")

// Quarterly depreciation (straight-line over 4 quarters)
let depreciation = leaseWithCosts.depreciation(period: q1)
print("Quarterly depreciation: \(depreciation.currency())")  // $111,454 ÷ 4 = $27,864

// Track carrying value each quarter

Q1 carrying value: $83,520
Q2 carrying value: $55,680
Q3 carrying value: $27,840
Q4 carrying value: $0
</code></pre><p><strong>The pattern</strong>: ROU asset decreases linearly by $27,864 each quarter until fully depreciated.</p><hr /><h3>Complete Income Statement Impact</h3><p>Each period has two expenses: interest and depreciation:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">print("\n=== Total P&L Impact by Quarter ===")

** Note: Expense is front-loaded due to higher interest in early periods
</code></pre><p><strong>The insight</strong>: Total expense ($115k) exceeds cash payments ($100k) because we’re expensing the upfront costs ($15k) over the lease term.</p><hr /><h3>Short-Term Lease Exemption</h3><p>Leases of 12 months or less can be expensed instead of capitalized:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">let shortTermLease = Lease(
    payments: payments,  // 4 quarterly payments = 12 months

    leaseTerm: .months(12)
)

if shortTermLease.isShortTerm {

    let rouAsset = shortTermLease.rightOfUseAsset()  // Returns 0
    print("ROU asset: \(rouAsset.currency())")
} else {
    print("Must capitalize lease")
}
</code></pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre><code>✓ Qualifies for short-term exemption
Can expense payments as incurred without capitalizing
ROU asset: $0.00
</code></pre><p><strong>The rule</strong>: Leases ≤ 12 months can be treated as operating expenses (no capitalization required).</p><hr /><h3>Low-Value Lease Exemption</h3><p>Leases of assets valued under $5,000 can also be expensed:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">// Small equipment lease
let lowValueLease = Lease(
    payments: payments,
    discountRate: 0.06,
    underlyingAssetValue: 4_500.0  // Below $5K threshold
)

if lowValueLease.isLowValue {
    print("\n✓ Qualifies for low-value exemption")
    print("Underlying asset value: \(lowValueLease.underlyingAssetValue!.currency())")
    print("Can expense payments as incurred")
}
</code></pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre><code>✓ Qualifies for low-value exemption
Underlying asset value: $4,500.00
Can expense payments as incurred
</code></pre><p><strong>The rule</strong>: Assets with fair value < $5,000 when new (e.g., laptops, small office equipment) can be expensed.</p><hr /><h3>Discount Rate Selection</h3><p>The discount rate significantly impacts lease valuation:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">print("\n=== Impact of Discount Rate ===")

// Conservative rate (lower discount = higher PV)
let lowRate = Lease(payments: payments, discountRate: 0.04)

// Market rate
let marketRate = Lease(payments: payments, discountRate: 0.06)

// Riskier rate (higher discount = lower PV)
let highRate = Lease(payments: payments, discountRate: 0.10)

print("At 4% rate: \(lowRate.presentValue().currency())")
print("At 6% rate: \(marketRate.presentValue().currency())")
print("At 10% rate: \(highRate.presentValue().currency())")

let difference = lowRate.presentValue() - highRate.presentValue()
print("\nDifference between 4% and 10%: \(difference.currency())")
</code></pre><p><strong>Output:</strong></p><pre><code>=== Impact of Discount Rate ===
At 4% rate: $97,549.14
At 6% rate: $96,359.62
At 10% rate: $94,049.36

Difference between 4% and 10%: $3,499.78
</code></pre><p><strong>The insight</strong>: Higher discount rates reduce the present value (and thus the balance sheet liability). Companies often use their incremental borrowing rate (IBR).</p><hr /><h3>Multi-Year Lease with Escalations</h3><p>Real-world leases often have annual rent increases:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">// 5-year office lease with 3% annual escalation
let startDate = Period.quarter(year: 2025, quarter: 1)
let fiveYearPeriods = (0..<20).map { startDate + $0 }  // 20 quarters

let baseRent = 30_000.0

for i in 0..<20 {
    let yearIndex = i / 4  // Which year (0-4)
    let escalatedRent = baseRent * pow(1.03, Double(yearIndex))

Their debt-to-equity ratio instantly increased from 1.5x to 2.8x.</p><p><strong>CFO use case</strong>: “We have 250 office leases across 30 countries. I need to calculate the total lease liability and ROU asset for our quarterly 10-Q filing, broken down by currency and region.”</p><p>BusinessMath makes this programmatic, auditable, and reproducible.</p><hr /><p><code>★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────</code></p><p><strong>Why the New Lease Accounting Standards?</strong></p><p>Under old rules (IAS 17 / FAS 13), operating leases were off-balance-sheet.</p><p>This meant:</p><ul><li><strong>Hidden leverage</strong>: Airlines had billions in lease obligations not on the balance sheet</li><li><strong>Comparability issues</strong>: Two identical companies with different lease-vs-buy decisions looked completely different financially</li><li><strong>Analyst adjustments</strong>: Every analyst had to manually capitalize operating leases to compare companies</li></ul><p>IFRS 16 / ASC 842 solved this by requiring capitalization of virtually all leases. Now the balance sheet reflects the economic reality: if you have the right to use an asset and an obligation to pay, that’s an asset and liability.</p><p><strong>Trade-off</strong>: More complexity, but greater transparency.</p><p><code>─────────────────────────────────────────────────</code></p><hr /><h3>📝 Development Note</h3><p>The hardest design decision for lease accounting was: <strong>How much to embed accounting rules in the API vs. leaving flexibility?</strong></p><p><strong>Example dilemma</strong>: Should <code>Lease.rightOfUseAsset()</code> automatically include initial direct costs? Or require the user to add them separately?</p><p>We chose <strong>automatic inclusion</strong> because:</p><ol><li>IFRS 16 / ASC 842 explicitly require it</li><li>Users who forget will have incorrect financials</li><li>Edge cases can override with optional parameters</li></ol><p>But this means the API embeds accounting assumptions. If standards change (e.g., IFRS 17 for insurance), the API must evolve.</p><p><strong>The lesson</strong>: For domain-specific APIs (accounting, tax, legal), embedding rules improves correctness but reduces flexibility. Choose based on your users’ expertise—CPAs benefit from enforced rules; accountants building custom models need flexibility.</p><p><strong>Related Methodology</strong>: <a href="../../week-01/02-tue-test-first-development">Test-First Development</a> (Week 1) - We wrote failing tests for IFRS 16 requirements first, ensuring compliance.</p><hr /><h2>Next Steps</h2><p><strong>Coming up next week</strong>: Week 5 explores loans, investments, and valuation techniques.</p><p><strong>Monday</strong>: Loan Amortization - Building schedules for mortgages, car loans, and term loans.</p><hr /><p><strong>Series Progress</strong>:</p><ul><li>Week: 4/12</li><li>Posts Published: 15/~48</li><li>Topics Covered: Foundation + Analysis + Operational + Financial Statements (complete)</li><li>Playgrounds: 14 available</li></ul></p><hr /><div style="margin-top: 2em"><p class="blurb" style="font-style: italic">Tagged with: businessmath, swift, leases, ifrs16, asc842, accounting, right-of-use-assets</p></div></div></div><header><nav class="noPrint navbar navbar-expand-md" style="border-top: 0.01em solid #d5d5d5;"><div class="container-fluid col"><button type="button" class="navbar-toggler btn" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarCollapse" aria-controls="navbarCollapse" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation"><span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span></button><div id="navbarCollapse" class="collapse navbar-collapse"><ul class="navbar-nav mb-2 mb-md-0 col"><li class="nav-item"><a href="mailto:morals.tech.0x@icloud.com" id="email" rel="me" target="_blank" class="nav-link">email</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="https://cal.com/jpurnell/15min" id="calendar" rel="me" target="_blank" class="nav-link">calendar</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="http://blog.justinpurnell.com" id="blog" rel="me" target="_blank" class="nav-link">blog</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="https://github.com/jpurnell" id="github" rel="me" target="_blank" class="nav-link">github</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/justinpurnell.com" id="bsky" rel="me" target="_blank" class="nav-link">bsky</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="https://mastodon.social/@jpurnell" id="mastodon" rel="me" target="_blank" class="nav-link">mastodon</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="https://music.apple.com/us/station/justin-purnells-station/ra.u-a475786ae9cc432a1abb70ff757aa95f" id="radio" rel="me" target="_blank" class="nav-link">radio</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="https://www.justinpurnell.com/feed.rss" id="rss" rel="me" target="_blank" class="nav-link">rss</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a href="#" id="theme-toggle" rel="me" target="_blank" class="nav-link">theme</a></li></ul></div></div></nav></header><script src="/js/theme-toggle.js"></script></div><script src="/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script><script src="/js/syntax-highlighting.js"></script></body></html>
