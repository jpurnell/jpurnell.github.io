She currently has $100,000 in her retirement account. Her financial advisor needs to answer two critical questions:</p><ol><li><strong>How much should Sarah contribute monthly</strong> to reach her goal?</li><li><strong>What’s the probability she’ll actually reach $2M</strong> given market volatility?</li></ol><p>This is a real problem financial advisors solve daily. Get it wrong, and Sarah either oversaves (reducing quality of life now) or undersaves (risking retirement security).</p><p>Let’s build a calculator that answers both questions using BusinessMath.</p><hr /><h2>The Requirements</h2><p><strong>Stakeholders</strong>: Financial advisors, retirement planners, individuals planning for retirement</p><p><strong>Key Questions</strong>:</p><ul><li>What monthly contribution is required?</li><li>What’s the future value of current savings?</li><li>How do market assumptions (return rate, volatility) affect the plan?</li><li>What’s the probability of success given realistic market conditions?</li></ul><p><strong>Success Criteria</strong>:</p><ul><li>Accurate TVM calculations</li><li>Probability analysis using statistical distributions</li><li>Scenario analysis for different risk profiles</li><li>Interactive playground for what-if analysis</li></ul><hr /><h2>The Solution</h2><h3>Part 1: Setup and Assumptions</h3><p>First, we define Sarah’s situation and market assumptions:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">import BusinessMath

print("=== RETIREMENT PLANNING CALCULATOR ===\n")

// Sarah's Current Situation
let currentAge = 35.0
let retirementAge = 65.0
let yearsUntilRetirement = retirementAge - currentAge  // 30 years
let currentSavings = 100_000.0
let targetAmount = 2_000_000.0

// Market Assumptions
let expectedReturn = 0.07      // 7% annual return (historical equity average)
let returnStdDev = 0.15        // 15% volatility (realistic for stock market)

print("Sarah's Profile:")
print("- Age: \(Int(currentAge))")
print("- Current Savings: \(currentSavings.currency())")
print("- Retirement Goal: \(targetAmount.currency())")
print("- Years to Retirement: \(Int(yearsUntilRetirement))")
print("- Expected Return: \(expectedReturn.percent())")
print("- Return Volatility: \(returnStdDev.percent())")
print()
</code></pre><p><strong>Output</strong>:</p><pre><code>=== RETIREMENT PLANNING CALCULATOR ===

Sarah's Profile:
- Age: 35
- Current Savings: $100,000
- Retirement Goal: $2,000,000
- Years to Retirement: 30
- Expected Return: 7%
- Return Volatility: 15%
</code></pre><hr /><h3>Part 2: Calculate Required Monthly Contribution</h3><p>Using TVM functions to determine the monthly contribution needed:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">print("PART 1: Required Contribution")

let monthlyRate = expectedReturn / 12.0
let numberOfPayments: Int = Int(yearsUntilRetirement) * 12

// Future value of current savings (no additional contributions)
let futureValueOfCurrentSavings = futureValue(
    presentValue: currentSavings,
    rate: expectedReturn,
	periods: Int(yearsUntilRetirement)
)

print("Future value of current $100K: \(futureValueOfCurrentSavings.currency())")

// Gap to fill with monthly contributions
let gapToFill = targetAmount - futureValueOfCurrentSavings
print("Gap to fill: \(gapToFill.currency())")

// Calculate required monthly payment
// Note: payment() returns negative value (cash outflow), so negate it
let requiredMonthlyContribution = -payment(
    presentValue: 0.0,
    futureValue: gapToFill,
    rate: monthlyRate,
    periods: numberOfPayments,
    type: .ordinary
)

print("Required monthly contribution: \(requiredMonthlyContribution.currency())")
print()
</code></pre><p><strong>Output</strong>:</p><pre><code>PART 1: Required Contribution
Future value of current $100K: $761,225.50
Gap to fill: $1,238,774.50
Required monthly contribution: $1,015.41
</code></pre><p><strong>The answer</strong>: Sarah needs to contribute <strong>$1,015.41 per month</strong> to reach her $2M goal.</p><hr /><h3>Part 3: Probability Analysis (Simplified Model)</h3><p>Now the harder question: Given market volatility, what’s the probability Sarah actually reaches $2M?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: This simplified analytical approach has limitations (see “What Didn’t Work” section). Monte Carlo simulation provides more accurate probability estimates.</p></blockquote><pre><code class="language-swift">print("PART 2: Success Probability Analysis")

// Total contributions over 30 years
let totalContributions = requiredMonthlyContribution * Double(numberOfPayments)
let totalInvested = currentSavings + totalContributions

print("Total contributions: \(totalContributions.currency())")
print("Total invested: \(totalInvested.currency())")

// For $2M target, what total return is required?
let minimumRequiredReturn = (targetAmount - totalInvested) / totalInvested

print("Minimum required total return: \(minimumRequiredReturn.percent())")

// Model market returns using log-normal distribution
let expectedTotalReturn = expectedReturn * yearsUntilRetirement
let totalReturnStdDev = returnStdDev * sqrt(yearsUntilRetirement)

// Probability of achieving required return
// CDF gives P(X <= x), we want P(X >= minimumRequiredReturn)
let prob = 1.0 - logNormalCDF(
    minimumRequiredReturn,
    mean: expectedTotalReturn,
    standardDeviation: totalReturnStdDev
)

print("Probability of reaching $2M goal: \((1.0 - probability).percent())")
print()
</code></pre><p><strong>Output</strong>:</p><pre><code>PART 2: Success Probability Analysis
Total contributions: $365,548.71
Total invested: $465,548.71
Minimum required total return: 329.60%
Probability of reaching $2M goal: [Value depends on calculation - see note below]
</code></pre><p><strong>Important Note</strong>: The probability calculation in this simplified example has a methodological issue. It calculates <code>minimumRequiredReturn = (target - totalInvested) / totalInvested</code> treating contributions as a lump sum, but the <code>payment()</code> function already accounts for monthly compounding. This causes the probability estimates to be unrealistic.</p><p><strong>A better approach</strong> (demonstrated in Week 6’s Monte Carlo case study): Simulate 10,000 scenarios where Sarah contributes monthly and returns vary each period according to the volatility. This gives much more realistic probability estimates for retirement planning.</p><hr /><h3>Part 4: Scenario Analysis</h3><p>Let’s see how different expected returns affect required monthly contributions:</p><pre><code class="language-swift">print("PART 3: What-If Scenarios")

let scenarios = [
    ("Conservative", 0.05, 0.10),  // Bonds, low risk
    ("Moderate", 0.07, 0.15),      // Balanced, medium risk
    ("Aggressive", 0.09, 0.20)     // Stocks, high risk
]

print("Required monthly contribution by strategy:")
for (name, returnRate, volatility) in scenarios {
    let monthlyRate = returnRate / 12.0
    let fvSavings = futureValue(

    let gap = targetAmount - fvSavings
    let monthlyPayment = -payment(
        presentValue: 0.0,
        futureValue: gap,
        rate: monthlyRate,
        periods: numberOfPayments,
        type: .ordinary
    )

// Calculate success probability using the volatility
  let totalContrib = monthlyPayment * Double(numberOfPayments)
  let totalInv = currentSavings + totalContrib
  let minReturn = (targetAmount - totalInv) / totalInv
  let expectedTotal = returnRate * yearsUntilRetirement
  let totalStdDev = volatility * sqrt(yearsUntilRetirement)

// CDF gives P(X <= minReturn), we want P(X >= minReturn)
	let successProb = 1.0 - logNormalCDF(
	  minReturn,
	  mean: expectedTotal,
	  stdDev: totalStdDev
  )

	print("\(name.padding(toLength: 15, withPad: " ", startingAt: 0))\(monthlyPayment.currency().paddingLeft(toLength: 15))\(successProb.percent().paddingLeft(toLength: 15))")
}
</code></pre><p><strong>Output</strong>:</p><pre><code>PART 3: What-If Scenarios

For example, we discovered our <code>payment</code> function didn’t handle the <code>type</code> parameter correctly (beginning vs. end of period).

The calculator should handle it gracefully.</li><li>Always include scenario analysis—users want “what-if” capabilities</li><li>Analytical probability calculations for annuities with volatility are complex—Monte Carlo is often more appropriate</li><li>It’s better to acknowledge methodological limitations than to present questionable numbers as authoritative</li></ul><p><strong>From the Development Journey</strong>:</p><blockquote><p>The first implementation calculated probability wrong. We used a point estimate of expected return instead of modeling the distribution.</p><p>The playground made the error obvious. When we printed intermediate values, we saw: “Probability: 50.0%” for every scenario. That’s suspicious—the actual probability should change based on assumptions!</p><p>Digging in, we realized we were essentially asking “What’s the probability of achieving the average return?” which is always ~50% for a symmetric distribution.</p><p>The correct question: “What’s the probability of achieving <em>at least</em> the minimum required return?” That requires integrating the probability distribution, which <code>normalCDF</code> does.</p><p><strong>Playground saved us from shipping a calculator that always said 50%.</strong></p></blockquote><hr /><h2>The Insight</h2><p>Case studies reveal integration issues that unit tests miss.</p><p><strong>Unit tests verify</strong>: “Does <code>futureValue</code> calculate correctly?”<strong>Case studies verify</strong>: “Do <code>futureValue</code>, <code>payment</code>, and <code>normalCDF</code> work together to solve real problems?”</p><p>When we wrote Sarah’s retirement calculator, we discovered:</p><ul><li>The <code>payment</code> function’s <code>type</code> parameter matters in practice</li><li>Probability calculation requires distribution modeling, not point estimates</li><li>Scenario analysis is essential—users want to explore trade-offs</li></ul><p>None of these issues appeared in unit tests. All appeared immediately in the case study.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Key Takeaway</strong>: Write case studies at topic milestones.
